      <h1>OUR ALGORITHMS</h1>
      <span></span>
      <p>The algorithm takes into account different social and geographical measures to determine the most fair
        configuration of precincts to counteract gerrymandering. The algorithm computes the independent score of
      four separate measures: compactness, population density, partisanship density, and racial breakdown and adds
      those scores together to obtain the optimal zoning for the congressional districts of the selected state.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Compactness Analysis</h2>
        <p>Our algorithm uses a mixture of compactness measures to determine compactness for districts, including
          the Polsby-Popper Test and Schwartzberg Compactness Measure to measure the compactness of the
          congressional districts. The more compact a district is, the better the score calculated by the algorithm.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Population Density Analysis</h2>
        <p>The algorithm takes district population into account when computing the overall goodness score. The closer
        the districts are to all having an even population, the higher the score.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Partisanship Analysis</h2>
        <p>We used 2016 Presidential Election data to determine the population of Democratic, Republican, and 3rd
        Party voters in each district. The algorithm score increases as the populations of these voters become
        more even per district.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Racial Analysis</h2>
        <p>We used 2010 census data that gave a 2016 estimate towards the populations of different races throughout
        the districts. The algorithm score increases as the populations of these demographics become more even per
        district.</p>
